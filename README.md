# Become-a-leader
Everyone has a ability to stand and delever infront of thousands of people.
But they don't have a courage to do this.
So what is the solution for that?
How to be courageous and stand infront of  thousands of people.
The simple thing is that we all have a gut, cause we all are human and our mind is almost equal.
So next, when we all have the same ability then why should one become a "LEADER" out of millions.
How we become full of courage?
The answer is simple, "Knowledge".
Knowledge gives you a confidence and confidence gives you "courage".
So how we gain knowledge?
Become a good "Learner" is a powerfull way to gain knowledge.
Learn not only social but also all the aspects from science to tec, art to economics.
When you learn then you speak about that topic and become a one out of hundereds.
Gain knowledge, learn more and more things and stand out infront of thousands of people.
And become a "leader"
